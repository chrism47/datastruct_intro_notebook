# datastruct_intro_notebook
An introduction to data structures in Python. 

It has moved from my blog to here as the result of an update to my site: chrismoulton.dev

It's a nice way to get hands on experience with the structures. Download the PDF and the accompanying notebook of data structures and dive in! 

The .ipynb file can be imported into either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. Just download it to the desired directory and import how you wish.
